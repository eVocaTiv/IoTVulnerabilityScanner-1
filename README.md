# IoTVulnerabilityScanner
An interactive IoT vulnerability scanner for detecting vulnerabilities in an enterprise network by scanning multiple communication protocols. The application scans through the given IP range, detects devices present on each IP and tries to log in into the IoT device by using the database given by the administrator. 

The app is meant for usage my an admin of the network who can detect such vulnerabilities and notify device owners insside the enterprise by email. (which is known whenever the IoT device would be configured to log in into the enterprise wireless network)

## Installation
Clone the repository and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Run the web application by using the command : `python3 app.py` and open the link in your browser. 
The repository contains a database **iot.db** which can be re-initialised by deleting the database and running the script `python3 extensions.py`

## Features
- Log in into the system by using admin credentials as {username: *admin*, password: *password*} 
- Enter range of IP to be scanned
- Add new tuple of default credentials
- Delete existing default credentials
- View default credentials table
- View all scan results performed so far (history)
- View current scan results after entering the IP range
- Notify admin via email (change receipent in app.py currently as *xyz@gmail.com* in *display_scan_results*().
- Notify device owners (*to be implemented*)
- View graphical history (*to be implemented*)
- Handling end-to-end exceptions (*to be implemented*)
- Adding functionality for additional protocols (*to be implemented*)
- Register an admin (*to be implemented*)

## Testing
For testing the code, we have used a Raspberry Pi 1B via Ethernet.
You can connect multiple IoT devices to the laptop network and run the application.
